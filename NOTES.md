# NOTES.md — Lineage backend scratch log

Chronological log of what was tried, what worked, and CockroachDB-specific gotchas so
later sessions don't re-walk dead ends. Newest notes at the bottom of each section.

## Phase 1

### Connection / driver
- `.env` var is `DATABASE_URL` = `postgresql://...@...cockroachlabs.cloud:26257/...?sslmode=verify-full`.
  No `sslrootcert` param — CRDB Cloud serves publicly-trusted certs, so `verify-full` works
  off the system trust store. Do not add a cert file.
- App (async) uses `postgresql+psycopg://` (psycopg 3). Alembic (sync) uses the same
  `postgresql+psycopg://` scheme — psycopg 3 supports both sync and async.
- `sslmode=verify-full` is a libpq/psycopg connect arg, passed straight through in the URL.

### CockroachDB-specific decisions
- **UUID PKs** with `gen_random_uuid()` server default — CRDB best practice, avoids
  sequential-insert range hotspots.
- **VECTOR column** on `beliefs.embedding`: dim **1536** (matches OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
  so Phase 2 needs no re-migration). Phase 1 seeds a *deterministic placeholder* vector
  (fixed-seed numpy, normalized) — clearly a placeholder; real embeddings computed in Phase 2.
  Embeddings drive vector SEARCH (Phase 2), not the staleness signal, so placeholder is honest.
- **Vector INDEX** (`CREATE VECTOR INDEX`, C-SPANN): deferred to Phase 2 (not needed by either
  heart endpoint). Column created now. TODO: confirm via MCP that the index type is available
  on Basic tier so Phase 2 has no surprise.
- Custom SQLAlchemy `Vector` type (app/types_crdb.py) renders `VECTOR(n)` DDL and marshals
  list[float] <-> '[..]' literal. NOT using the pgvector package (targets PG extension; don't
  want to rely on OID-compat guesses).

### AS OF SYSTEM TIME (the heart)
- AOST **cannot take a bind parameter** — the timestamp must be inlined in SQL text.
  Therefore validate/normalize the incoming `as_of` ourselves (no raw string reaches SQL):
    * ISO-8601 -> parse with datetime.fromisoformat, re-serialize, wrap in quotes.
    * HLC decimal (what cluster_logical_timestamp() returns) -> use bare/unquoted.
    * anything else -> 400.
- Mechanism: transaction-scoped AOST. On a single AsyncConnection, in an explicit
  transaction, the FIRST statement is `SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME <literal>`, then a
  normal SQLAlchemy select. Only the timestamp is ever inlined; the query stays parameterized.
- Guaranteeing same physical connection + no autocommit: use `async with engine.connect()`
  (one AsyncConnection == one pooled DBAPI connection) + `async with conn.begin()` (explicit
  txn). Engine is NOT in AUTOCOMMIT isolation. See app/services/time_travel.py.
- TODO (MCP): confirm which builtin reflects the AOST read timestamp inside the txn
  (cluster_logical_timestamp vs transaction_timestamp) for the test's positive
  "AOST-engaged" assertion.
- Time-travel depth bounded by `gc.ttlseconds`. TODO (MCP): record Basic-tier default.
  The done-test only looks seconds back, well within GC.

### CONFIRMED via scripts/probe_crdb.py (direct psycopg connection, 2026-07-01)
- **Cluster:** CockroachDB CCL **v25.4.10**, region `aws-eu-central-1` (Frankfurt).
- **VECTOR type:** works — `VECTOR(3)` DDL + `'[1,2,3]'` insert/select roundtrip OK.
- **VECTOR INDEX:** `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` is **AVAILABLE on Basic tier** — Phase 2 vector
  search has no surprise. (Still deferring index creation to Phase 2.)
- **gc.ttlseconds = 4500 (75 min)** on RANGE default → max AOST time-travel depth is 75 min.
  Done-test only reaches seconds back — safe.
- **AOST read-timestamp builtin = `cluster_logical_timestamp()`.** Inside a txn with
  `SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME {t0}`, `cluster_logical_timestamp()` == t0 **exactly**;
  a fresh non-AOST read returns a later value. `transaction_timestamp()`/`now()` also reflect
  the historical wall time, but `statement_timestamp()` keeps advancing (real clock) — do NOT
  use statement_timestamp for the AOST-engaged assertion. Use cluster_logical_timestamp equality.
- **Connection stack gotchas (Windows):**
  1. psycopg async needs `WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy` (default Proactor loop errors).
  2. `sslmode=verify-full` + libpq 14 (bundled in psycopg[binary]) → no `sslrootcert=system`
     support (that's libpq 16+). Point `sslrootcert` at `certifi.where()` (Mozilla bundle);
     CRDB Cloud certs chain to it.
  3. Generic postgresql dialect can't parse CRDB's `version()` string → use the
     **`cockroachdb+psycopg://`** dialect (sqlalchemy-cockroachdb). Not a stack substitution;
     it's the SQLAlchemy dialect for our chosen DB, running on psycopg 3.

### Phase 1 DONE (2026-07-01)
- Migration applied to live cluster (all 5 tables + indexes). Seed: 24 agents / 2 bloodlines,
  1 founding belief down crimson spine + 1 branch edge (crimson-4 -> crimson-5b), 8 inheritance rows.
- Endpoints live and returning real cluster data:
  * GET /agents/{id}/beliefs?as_of=  (real SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME; ISO + HLC forms)
  * GET /beliefs/{id}/lineage         (recursive CTE; returns 9-node tree incl. branch)
- Tests: `pytest` -> 2 passed. test_aost_hides_a_committed_write proves MVCC time-travel
  (t0 captured -> commit -> re-query@t0 still N, now N+1) + positive AOST-engaged assertion
  (cluster_logical_timestamp()==t0 inside txn). test_lineage_resolves_full_spine_and_branch.
- Diagnostic scripts kept: scripts/probe_crdb.py, scripts/demo_endpoints.py.
- DO NOT start Phase 2 (agents / belief_performance / OpenAI) without approval.

### Time concepts — do not conflate
- CRDB **MVCC time-travel** (AOST) = DB state as of a past *transaction* time. Phase 1 proves this.
- `formed_at` / `belief_performance.window_*` = app-level columns; they drive the Phase 2/3
  staleness story ("valid then / rotten now"). Different clock. Phase 1 does not touch staleness.

## Phase 2

### Plan (approved)
- Keep Phase 1 seed + tests intact. Backfill real historical `decisions` (deterministic,
  OpenAI-FREE) across the belief-holding generations; prove the live spawn once
  (crimson-7 -> crimson-8) later. Hermetic offline done-test. C-SPANN vector search. No new
  table (decisions IS the record). 250 belief-driven decisions/window (SE ~0.032 worst case).
- Integrity line: the WORLD drifts (transaction fraud labels shift over time); the belief and
  the agent's application are fixed; performance is ALWAYS the aggregation of verdict-vs-fraud.
  Never write a confidence number. The counterfactual recovery test is the proof.

### Migration 0002 (applied to live cluster, committed)
- DDL only, OpenAI-free: `CREATE VECTOR INDEX ix_beliefs_embedding ON beliefs (embedding)`
  (raw op.execute — Alembic can't emit CRDB vector DDL) + btree
  `ix_decisions_belief_time` on decisions(driving_belief_id, decided_at) = the access path
  for per-window aggregation. Alembic logs "Will assume non-transactional DDL" — CRDB runs
  the vector-index create fine outside a txn. Re-embedding the belief with a REAL vector is
  deferred to the post-gate agent-brain phase (it needs OpenAI; pre-gate stays offline).

### Deterministic backfill (app/sim/transactions.py + seed/backfill_decisions.py)
- Drift is a 3-layer stochastic process, all seeded (world SEED=20260701, policy seed 7788):
  hidden logistic trend + per-window Gaussian regime shock + a modeled fraud CAMPAIGN that
  spikes ~gen5 and recedes gen6 + Bernoulli sampling per txn. Off-pattern background fraud is
  non-zero & flat. Nothing about performance is written; only labels + verdicts.
- Decision policy: target-pattern (mcc 5411, <$180, age>6mo) -> approve, driving_belief=origin
  (the belief-driven subset). Everything else -> generic verdict, driving_belief=NULL (table
  realism only; excluded from this belief's performance). Window i -> crimson-i; window 5
  splits ~30% to living branch crimson-5b.
- **Emergent curve (4000 rows, computed from raw decisions, matches the intent):**
  conf g0..g7 = .924 .952 .876 .852 .724 .556 **.624** .528 ; fraud% 7.6->47.2 ;
  frauds_approved 19->118. The gen-6 bump (.556->.624->.528) is the campaign recession dip —
  a monotone sigmoid could never produce it. fp_rate == 0 across all windows and is HONEST:
  this belief only ever approves, so its failure mode is approving fraud (false negatives),
  never false positives. Baseline off-pattern fraud wobbles 1.2%-6.4%, no trend.

### Gotchas
- `seed/` must be run as a module (`python -m seed.backfill_decisions`), NOT as a file path —
  running the file puts seed/ on sys.path[0] and shadows the `seed` package self-import.
- 4000-row ORM `add_all` + commit over CRDB Cloud takes ~60s (server-default UUID PKs force
  per-row RETURNING). Fine for a one-shot backfill; if it ever needs to be faster, switch to
  client-side uuid4 ids + a bulk `insert()` executemany.
- Python block-buffers stdout to a file — a long backfill shows NO output until it exits.
  Don't mistake a buffered run for a hang.

### Live agent (app/services/agent_brain.py + openai_client.py + embeddings.py)
- **AVG antivirus MITMs outbound HTTPS (port 443).** It presents a cert signed by AVG's local
  root CA (env leaks `SSLKEYLOGFILE=\\.\avgMonFltProxy\...`). That CA is in the Windows trust
  store but NOT in certifi's bundle -> default httpx/openai fail CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED.
  Fix: app/services/openai_client.py builds the AsyncOpenAI with an SSL context from
  `create_default_context()` + `load_default_certs(SERVER_AUTH)` (Windows ROOT store). CRDB is
  unaffected (port 26257, not intercepted) and keeps its own certifi handling in app/config.py.
- Retrieval uses CRDB cosine vector search: `embedding <=> (:qvec)::VECTOR(1536)` ORDER BY,
  over the agent's active held beliefs. Operators `<->`/`<=>`/`<#>` all work on v25.4.10.
- Decision brain: gpt-4o-mini, strict json_schema response_format, temperature 0. is_fraud
  (ground truth) is stored but NEVER put in the prompt. Model returns exact driving_belief_id;
  we validate it against the retrieved candidates (no dangling refs) before persisting.
- Live demo verified (scripts/demo_agent.py): crimson-7 APPROVED a window-7 fraud @0.95,
  citing the origin belief — the stale-belief harm, real API call end to end.

### Lifecycle (app/services/lifecycle.py)
- spawn_child(parent) = insert child + one belief_inheritance edge per ACTIVE held belief +
  retire parent, all in ONE `async with s.begin()` transaction (atomic). Child immediately
  resolves in the Phase-1 lineage CTE with zero changes to it.

### belief_performance (app/services/performance.py)
- recompute_belief_performance(belief_id, windows): DELETE this belief's rows, then one row
  per non-empty window from the SAME aggregation the backfill report used. confidence =
  correct/total; nothing hardcoded. generation_windows() (app/sim/transactions.py) gives the
  8 gen windows so backfill + performance bucket identically.

### Phase 2 DONE (2026-07-01)
- All 4 tests pass (2 Phase-1 + 2 Phase-2), Phase 1 untouched:
  * test_staleness_emerges_and_recovers — COUNTERFACTUAL: seeds controlled decisions (5% fraud
    early / 55% late) -> early conf 0.95, late 0.45; flip late is_fraud=false -> late RECOVERS
    to 1.00. Proves staleness is DERIVED, not stored (the Phase-2 kill-shot).
  * test_spawn_inherits_active_beliefs — spawn crimson-7 -> crimson-8, real inheritance edges,
    child in lineage, parent retired.
- Demos: scripts/demo_agent.py (live OpenAI verdict), scripts/demo_staleness.py (visible
  counterfactual recovery). Both reseed first.
- Openai==1.59.6 added to requirements. gpt-4o-mini + text-embedding-3-small.
- NOT YET DONE (deferred / Phase 3): belief_performance is written by an explicit recompute
  call, not yet auto-driven by a running fleet; no atomic invalidation endpoint / S3 cert /
  Lambda yet (that's Phase 3). Do not start Phase 3 without approval.

## Phase 3

### Plan (approved 2026-07-03)
- Approved: reuse belief_inheritance for the closure state (per-edge revocation — the
  constitution's own wording says the closure is "via belief_inheritance"; NOT a new fleet
  table, NOT a single-row belief flip which wouldn't exercise cross-key atomic txns).
  Certifier-only Lambda. Cert integrity = sha256 + AOST-reproducibility (no HMAC — the AOST
  cross-check is the stronger proof). Leaked-fraud proof uses the Phase-2 DETERMINISTIC
  predicate (matches_target), not live OpenAI (avoids flaky API calls in a timing test).
  Plain-zip Lambda deploy, no IaC. Sequenced steps 1-9, gate hard at step 1.

### Step 1 — AWS probe GATE (scripts/probe_aws.py)
- **AVG antivirus MITMs boto3 too** (same 443 interception as OpenAI in Phase 2). Fix lives
  in app/services/aws_client.py: merge certifi + the Windows ROOT store (which holds AVG's
  installed CA) into one PEM bundle, point botocore's `verify` at it. Real TLS verification,
  never verify=False. No-op on Linux (Lambda) — enum_certificates is Windows-only there.
- **Gate result:** creds OK (arn user/lineage-app, acct 265243686715); S3 head-bucket +
  PUT/GET/DELETE round-trip OK; lambda:ListFunctions OK; **iam:CreateRole DENIED**. So the
  Lambda EXECUTION ROLE cannot be created from this IAM user — needs a console-level fix by
  the account owner. This blocks ONLY step 8. Steps 2-7 use the S3 creds directly, unblocked.
- AWS config flows through Settings (pydantic reads .env but does NOT export to os.environ, so
  boto3 couldn't see the creds); aws_client passes them explicitly when present, else falls
  back to the default chain (for Lambda's execution role). Optional fields, default None.
- boto3==1.35.71 added to requirements.

### Step 2 — migration 0003 (applied to live cluster, committed)
- belief_inheritance.invalidated_at / invalidated_by (per-holder closure revocation — the
  MULTI-ROW target that makes the atomic txn load-bearing). + audit_log table (actor,
  affected counts, commit_hlc, cert pointer/status/hash, created_at). Lineage CTE stays
  UNFILTERED so provenance/trace still fully resolve (annotate revocation, never delete).

### Step 3 — atomic invalidation (app/services/invalidation.py)
- invalidate_belief(): ONE serializable txn. FOR UPDATE the belief (idempotency guard ->
  AlreadyInvalidated), then SET-BASED UPDATEs (beliefs + `UPDATE belief_inheritance ... WHERE
  belief_id=X`) — all holders at once, NO per-holder loop. audit_log written in the same txn.
- **Snapshot-HLC subtlety:** cluster_logical_timestamp() is captured on a SEPARATE read
  connection BEFORE the write txn opens. HLC is monotonic => strictly earlier than the commit
  ts. If captured INSIDE the write txn it could equal the commit ts (MVCC reads at exactly ts
  see writes at ts) and the certificate's "belief was active before" AOST proof would be
  circular. Verified: AOST @ snapshot_hlc shows active / all-8-edges-open.

### Step 4 — certificate + S3 (certificate.py, s3_audit.py)
- Cert JSON: belief before/after, staleness_evidence pulled from REAL belief_performance
  (first vs last window confidence + last-window frauds_approved — valid-then/rotten-now,
  never asserted), affected_closure, db_snapshot_hlc, content_hash = "sha256:" + hexdigest
  over canonical (sorted-key) JSON minus the hash. verify() re-derives it.
- s3_audit put/get via real boto3 (asyncio.to_thread from the async endpoint). POST-COMMIT
  side effect: a failed PUT marks audit_log.cert_status='failed', never rolls back the durable
  invalidation. Smoke: PUT->GET round-trip re-verifies the hash; AOST@db_snapshot_hlc active.

### Step 5 — POST /beliefs/{id}/invalidate (routers/beliefs.py)
- Orchestrates invalidate -> gather staleness -> build cert -> put (to_thread) -> stamp
  audit_log. BeliefNotFound->404, AlreadyInvalidated->409. Response carries the cert outcome.

### Step 6 — tests/test_atomic_invalidation.py (4 pass, ~132s, live cluster + real S3)
- atomic closure (all 8 edges flip, 0 open, audit counts right) / idempotent (2nd raises,
  1 audit row) / cert S3 round-trip + hash re-verify / **AOST reproducibility**: cert's
  db_snapshot_hlc replays AS OF SYSTEM TIME to reproduce the pre-kill world (active,
  all-open) — CRDB time-travel is the oracle, so the cert can't lie about history.

### Step 7 — consistency proof (app/services/consistency.py, test + demo)
- eventual_invalidate = per-holder fan-out baseline (N+1 separate commits, per-holder delay
  models fan-out latency). observe_closure = concurrent sampler classifying ALL_ACTIVE /
  SPLIT / ALL_INVALIDATED. Measured: strong = 1 commit / 0 split samples (transition still
  witnessed); eventual = 9 commits / split samples observed. Delay-FREE fact: 1 vs 9 commit
  points => split state unreachable vs reachable. Leaked-fraud (deterministic matches_target,
  per-holder edge view): a committed mid-fan-out state => crimson-7 APPROVES the fraud while
  crimson-5b BLOCKS; the atomic correction erases that state. 3 tests pass.
- **Observer flake fixed:** observer sets a `ready` event after its connection is live + first
  sample; the strategy gates on it. Otherwise CRDB Cloud's ~1s TLS handshake outlasts a
  guessed pre-delay and the observer misses a fast strong commit (all samples ALL_INVALIDATED).
- **CRDB gotcha:** two concurrent `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` (I accidentally double-ran the demo)
  -> "cannot perform TRUNCATE on decisions which has indexes being dropped" (TRUNCATE drops/
  recreates indexes; overlapping jobs collide). Transient; clears when the schema-change job
  settles. Don't run two reseeds at once.

### Full regression: 11 tests pass (4 Phase-1/2 + 4 atomic-invalidation + 3 consistency).

### Step 8 — certifier Lambda DONE (2026-07-03)
- Role provided by owner: `arn:aws:iam::265243686715:role/lineage-certifier-role`
  (AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole + inline s3:PutObject/GetObject on the bucket). lineage-app
  created the FUNCTION against it with no new IAM perms — the gate fix worked as planned.
- **Standalone independent auditor** (endpoint UNTOUCHED): invoke with {belief_id}; reads
  audit_log for snapshot_hlc, replays AS OF SYSTEM TIME to confirm belief active + closure
  8/8 open BEFORE the kill, builds the cert (+ hash-covered aost_verification stamp), PUTs to
  S3, stamps audit_log cert_status='written'. lambda/certifier/{handler,build,deploy}.py.
- **certificate.py made import-safe**: top-level app/SQLAlchemy imports moved lazily inside
  gather_staleness_evidence, so the Lambda can `import certificate` with zero app deps
  (app.config requires OPENAI_API_KEY/DATABASE_URL — would crash on Lambda). build_certificate
  gained `extra` (merged BEFORE hashing). Endpoint path unchanged, still tested.
- **Packaging (no Docker):** pip install --platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --only-binary=:all:
  --python-version 3.12 --implementation cp psycopg[binary]==3.2.3 certifi. Pulls the
  cp312-manylinux2014_x86_64 psycopg-binary wheel; zip carries real x86_64-linux-gnu .so
  (4.7 MB, direct upload). boto3 NOT packed (in the runtime). Docker was the named fallback,
  not needed. AWS CLI absent -> boto3 deploy (create_function / update_function_code+config).
- **TLS verify-full from Lambda worked FIRST TRY** — the flagged risk (Linux libpq finding a
  CA for CRDB Cloud) was pre-empted by packaging certifi + passing sslrootcert=certifi.where()
  to psycopg.connect (mirrors the app's Windows fix). No sslmode downgrade.
- Handler is SYNC psycopg 3 (no asyncio); AOST via autocommit=False + first-statement
  SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME {hlc} (hlc inlined, validated numeric — our own value).
- Real invocation (scripts/demo_certifier.py): aost_verified=true, cert in S3, sha256
  re-verified after GET, audit_log.cert_status=written. DATABASE_URL/S3_BUCKET = encrypted
  Lambda env vars. Build artifacts (package/, *.zip) gitignored — rebuild via build.py.
- Redeploy: `python lambda/certifier/build.py && python lambda/certifier/deploy.py`.

### PHASE 3 COMPLETE (2026-07-03) — all 8 steps done. 11 tests pass (4 P1/2 + 4 invalidation
### + 3 consistency). Money-shots live: atomic closure invalidation endpoint, sha256+AOST
### certificate to real S3, measured atomic-vs-eventual consistency proof, certifier Lambda.

## Phase 4 (LEAN) — approved 2026-07-03

Scope: NOT full hardening. Just "nothing 500s embarrassingly in a live demo" + one scoped SSE
addition + one CI workflow. Approved with an explicit correction (see actor validation below).

### Validation + rate limiting (app/schemas.py, services/time_travel.py, ratelimit.py, main.py)
- **actor_id on POST /invalidate — do NOT validate against `agents`.** Explicit design call:
  `agents` = the supervised AI fleet (crimson/azure). The human supervisor doing the
  invalidation is NOT a fleet agent (invalidation is THE one governed human action). So we
  only require a well-formed, non-null identifier: `uuid.UUID` already gives well-formed, and
  a field_validator rejects the all-zeros nil UUID (→422) so a "null identifier" can't produce
  a dangling audit row. Real non-fleet supervisor UUIDs pass through (test proves 200). Real
  actor referential integrity would need a dedicated supervisors/actors table — out of scope.
- **AOST out-of-window → 400, not 500.** A well-formed `as_of` older than the GC TTL (4500s)
  or in the future fails INSIDE CRDB at `SET TRANSACTION AS OF SYSTEM TIME`. time_travel now
  catches that DBAPIError, matches known CRDB substrings, and re-raises ValueError → the router
  maps it to 400. Parse errors were already 400 via normalize_as_of.
- **Rate limiter: hand-rolled, no new dep (chose over slowapi).** Per-(IP, route-template)
  fixed window; route template collapses UUID segments so varying the id can't dodge the limit.
  Concurrency-safe by an `asyncio.Lock` around the read-modify-write with NO await in the
  critical section — a naive unlocked dict would over-admit under a burst (test fires 200
  concurrent checks at a budget of 100 and asserts EXACTLY 100 admitted). 60/min/route default,
  /health exempt, 429 + Retry-After. Middleware in main.py.

### SSE — GET /demo/consistency/stream (sse-starlette; routers/demo.py)
- Streams the eventual fan-out's REAL observer samples live. Verified via scripts/demo_sse.py:
  closure drains 8/8 → 7/8 → ... → 0/8 open over ~7s, SPLIT window plainly visible, then
  ALL_INVALIDATED. Events: start / sample* / summary (+ busy). Summary reports 9 commit points
  vs the atomic endpoint's 1.
- **Deliberately NOT on the lineage trace** — the recursive CTE is ms, so streaming it would be
  fake server-side pacing. The eventual fan-out has genuine multi-second timing worth streaming.
- observe_closure gained an ADDITIVE `on_sample` callback (return value + 3 consistency tests
  unchanged). Chose sse-starlette over hand-rolled StreamingResponse: it owns the event-stream
  wire format, keep-alive pings, and disconnect cleanup — not worth risking a protocol bug on
  camera.
- **This endpoint MUTATES demo state** (reseeds, runs the fan-out to invalidation). A
  module-level single-flight guard serializes concurrent streams so two reseeds can't collide on
  TRUNCATE CASCADE; a `busy` event is sent if one is already in flight. try/finally reaps the
  observer/fanout tasks on client disconnect (GeneratorExit). Repeatable — every run reseeds.
  (Guard hardened post-audit — see "Post-audit integrity fixes" below.)

### CI — .github/workflows/ci.yml (push to main, sequential pytest)
- Single ubuntu job, Python 3.12, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `pytest`. No matrix, no
  xdist (matches local; each test reseeds, so intra-run is serial and safe).
- **GitHub secrets required:** DATABASE_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  AWS_REGION, S3_BUCKET. OPENAI_API_KEY is a DUMMY literal in the workflow env (needed only for
  app.config import; no test makes a real OpenAI call) — do NOT add the real key as a secret.
- **`concurrency: cancel-in-progress`** cancels an in-flight run when a newer push lands →
  prevents CI-vs-CI double-TRUNCATE collision.
- **CI-vs-LOCAL collision: DOCUMENTED, not engineered around.** There is ONE Cloud cluster, so
  if you run tests/demos LOCALLY while a push CI run is live, both reseed the same cluster and
  can collide (the "indexes being dropped" TRUNCATE gotcha) → a flaky run. Don't do both at
  once. Full isolation would need a separate CI database on the cluster (a distinct
  DATABASE_URL secret) — available if flakes ever appear, but beyond lean scope. No test-code
  changes were needed either way.

### Phase 4 (lean) status: 18 tests pass (11 prior + 6 validation/rate-limit + 1 SSE).

## Pre-frontend increment (2026-07-03) — read surface + 2 post-audit integrity fixes

Tightly-scoped increment before the frontend build. Addresses AUDIT.md §8 (missing read routes)
and two AUDIT.md Part A integrity items. Explicitly NOT any of the Part C proposals (C1–C4
deferred). Suite is now 25 tests (18 prior + 3 read-endpoint + 3 certificate + 1 SSE
single-flight); all 7 new tests pass, and every prior test exercising the changed code
(atomic-invalidation ×4 with the new pre_state assertion, consistency ×3) passes.
- **Full-suite flake — cause NOT captured, do not assume.** One 10-min serial full run came
  back 24/25 with `test_arbitrary_nonfleet_actor_is_accepted` failing. The failing traceback
  was lost (a `tail -20` on the run truncated it), so there is NO captured status/body for it.
  What was subsequently established:
    * It does NOT reproduce: passes alone; passed in a partial re-run (12/25 green, killed before
      reaching it); passed in a targeted tail rerun `test_time_travel + test_validation` (7/7).
    * The rate limiter is RULED OUT by construction (not by counting): `app/ratelimit.py` is a
      persistent session-global bucket store with no conftest reset fixture, BUT the window
      self-resets (`now - start >= window_seconds`) and this test makes exactly ONE HTTP call to
      the `/beliefs/:id/invalidate` bucket, which sees ~3 lifetime hits across the whole suite,
      each >60s apart — a 429 is unreachable. (Latent note: the global-with-no-reset IS real
      test-coupling; harmless today because no route is hit ≥60x within a window, but a future
      test that does would need an autouse limiter-reset fixture.)
    * Not a regression from this stream: the change touches neither seeding nor the accept path.
  Leading (UNCONFIRMED) candidate by elimination is shared-cluster reseed/AOST timing, consistent
  with the documented TRUNCATE-job-lag gotcha (Phase 3, Step 7) — but this was NOT confirmed with
  a captured traceback and must not be written down as the cause until it is. If it recurs,
  capture full `--tb=long` output (never pipe the run through `tail`) before concluding.

### Read surface for the frontend (app/services/catalog.py + routers)
- **GET /agents** — full genealogy (id, generation, bloodline, status, spawned_at, retired_at,
  parent_id). NO pagination: the tree needs every node and the genealogy is bounded-small by the
  data model. Optional `?bloodline=` / `?status=` filters. Envelope `{agents, count}`.
- **GET /decisions** — the decision feed. `?agent_id` is OPTIONAL (design correction from the
  approver): default is the FLEET-WIDE feed across all agents (newest first) — what the decision
  panel renders; passing agent_id narrows to one agent's history for the investigate flow.
  PAGINATED (decisions grows to thousands of rows): `?limit` (default 50, max 200, `Query(le=200)`
  → guarded 422, never 500) + `?offset`, returns `{decisions, total, limit, offset, agent_id}`.
- **GET /beliefs** — belief catalog, full list (bounded-small), optional `?status=`. Envelope
  `{beliefs, count}`. Added `invalidated_at` (optional) to BeliefOut so the frontend can flag
  invalidated beliefs; deposition/lineage SELECTs that don't fetch it default to null.
- All three are current-state reads (NO AOST — that stays the deposition path), raw SQL on
  `engine.connect()`, filters always bind params (no string interpolation). New reusable
  `app/services/catalog.py` (list_agents / list_decisions / list_beliefs), not diagnostic scripts.
- **Seed gotcha for tests:** `seed.seed()` leaves `decisions` EMPTY (Phase-1 genealogy only), so
  the /decisions test inserts a controlled set via `insert(Decision)` before asserting. Also both
  spine heads live (crimson-7 AND azure-7) + branch leaf crimson-5b = 3 alive agents; only the
  crimson belief is seeded.

### Post-audit integrity fixes
- **Self-contained certificate (closes the undocumented 75-min gc.ttlseconds exposure — AUDIT §6
  / Part B #3).** The cert body now carries `pre_invalidation_state`: the MEASURED "belief active,
  whole closure open" fact, captured INSIDE the invalidation txn BEFORE the flip (endpoint path,
  source='issue-time-read') or from the certifier Lambda's independent AOST replay
  (source='aost-replay'). It is hash-covered, so the document proves the pre-kill world on its own.
  AS OF SYSTEM TIME replay drops from SOLE integrity mechanism to a BONUS freshness cross-check —
  it no longer silently loses its guarantee once the MVCC snapshot ages past the GC TTL. Mechanics:
  invalidation.invalidate_belief captures pre-kill edge total/open in-txn and returns `pre_state`;
  certificate.build_certificate embeds it (falls back to deriving from affected counts if a caller
  omits it, source='derived', so the field is ALWAYS present). Hermetic test_certificate.py (pure
  build_certificate, ZERO cluster/S3) proves present + hash-covered + tamper-evident; the live S3
  round-trip test asserts it survives GET + hash re-verify.
- **SSE single-flight guard (closes the _stream_lock TOCTOU — AUDIT §2).** Old guard was
  `if _stream_lock.locked(): busy` THEN `async with _stream_lock` — two near-simultaneous requests
  could both see the lock free, fall through, and the second would BLOCK on acquire then run a
  surprise second reseed. Replaced with a module-level bool `_stream_active` test-and-set: a
  synchronous read-then-write with NO await between them → atomic on the single-threaded event loop,
  so a concurrent second request ALWAYS gets a clean `busy` and never queues a reseed. Outer
  try/finally releases the flag on completion, run_seed error, or client disconnect. The bool
  subsumes the old lock's reseed-serialization (only one stream runs). Hermetic test parks the first
  stream (patched run_seed on a gate) and probes with a second, asserting busy + seed called once.

## Frontend Phase 2 — the console shell (2026-07-04)

NOTE: "Frontend Phase 2" is the FRONTEND phase ladder in FRONTEND.md (scaffold → shell →
interactions → …), NOT the backend's Phase 2 (agents/OpenAI) above. Different ladders; do
not conflate the numbers. Backend is frozen this phase except nothing — no backend changes.

### Scope
- The three-region console shell (decision feed / genealogy tree / inspector), populated with
  REAL data from GET /agents, /decisions, /beliefs. Purely presentational: NO interactions
  (investigate/trace/time-travel/invalidate are Frontend Phase 3), no motion, no color warmth
  (warmth stays reserved for the Phase-3 trace so it lands hard). Tokens reused from tokens.css,
  not re-derived. No new frontend dependencies (framer-motion/lenis/r3f are later phases).
- Built in 3 stages, committed each: A shell+data layer, B the SVG tree (checkpoint), C feed+
  inspector.

### Stage A — shell + data layer (committed)
- `src/hooks/useConsoleData.ts` fires the 3 reads in PARALLEL as independent Loadable slots
  (loading|error|ready) so one slow/failed source degrades locally instead of blanking the shell.
- `src/App.tsx` = CSS-grid shell: header (fleet summary "N alive / N agents") + 3 regions
  `[feed | tree | inspector]`, `height:100vh; overflow:hidden`, each panel scrolls its own body.
  `src/components/Panel.tsx` = shared chrome (`Panel` + `Loaded<T>` render-prop for the states).
- Replaced the Phase-1 throwaway proof in App.tsx/App.css.

### Stage B — genealogy SVG tree (committed; CHECKPOINT stage)
- `src/lib/treeLayout.ts` = pure, React-free layout. gen→x (col), bloodline→band, main line on
  lane 0 with offshoots below. **Lane rule is data-driven, no name parsing:** the "main child" =
  child with the MOST descendants keeps the parent's lane (so the spine reaching gen 7 stays on
  lane 0); other children drop to the first free lane (tracked by (lane,gen) occupancy so
  offshoots at distinct gens share lane 1). Bands ordered most-alive-first (crimson on top: 2
  living holders vs azure's 1). Edges = every real parent→child link; branch = lane-changing edge.
- **The API has NO agent-name field** (AgentGenealogy = id/generation/bloodline/status/parent_id).
  So a node's identity is its real generation digit (in the circle) + a real 6-char UUID fragment
  below. We do NOT print the seed's "crimson-5b" — that string isn't in any API response, and
  FRONTEND.md forbids fabricated labels.
- `GenealogyTree.tsx` + `.css`: SVG scales to the region via `viewBox`+`preserveAspectRatio
  =xMidYMid meet` → fits without scrolling at 1280/1440/1920. Dead = hollow --ash circle; alive =
  --alive ring + halo + brightened gen/id. Bloodlines distinguished by band+label ONLY (no color —
  keeps the world cold). Branch edges dashed, spine edges solid. HTML legend overlay (alive/dead/
  branch). Gen axis 0..7 at the bottom.

### Stage B self-critique vs FRONTEND.md (screenshots at 1280/1440/1920, headless chromium)
- PASS: forensic/clinical/cold (mono ids on a cold grid, banded records); warmth-free (only
  --alive on the 3 living nodes); static SVG; dead-vs-alive strongly distinct; generational and
  no-scroll at all three widths; topology correct (crimson spine 0-7 + offshoots @2,3,5,6 with the
  living branch at gen5; azure mirror, all azure offshoots dead).
- **crimson-5b (the 2nd living belief-holder) reads clearly in the secondary lane** — user's flagged
  concern. It gets the SAME alive emphasis (ring+halo+bright label) as the gen-7 spine tips, so it
  never reads as a minor branch. Verified in all 3 shots.
- Minor/accepted: (1) vertical whitespace — the wide-short tree centers in a tall column, leaving
  calm negative space; kept centered (reads more balanced than top-anchored). More prominent at
  1920. (2) branch edges are faint cold dashed; the edge to the living crimson-5b is subtle by
  design — Phase-3 trace warmth is the right place to emphasize it, not Phase 2. (3) fonts are the
  token FALLBACK stack (Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono not yet self-hosted) — FRONTEND.md
  defers real web fonts to a later phase.

### Cluster/tooling notes
- **/decisions is EMPTY on the cluster right now** (agents=24, beliefs=1, decisions=0). seed.seed()
  leaves decisions empty; the Phase-2/3 backfill wasn't re-run. The feed renders an honest "no
  decisions" empty state. Rerun `python -m seed.backfill_decisions` before evaluating Stage C.
- **Vite dev server binds to `localhost` (IPv6 ::1), NOT 127.0.0.1** — curl/playwright must use
  `http://localhost:5173`. Backend CORS allowlist is exactly localhost:5173 + 127.0.0.1:5173
  (app/main.py), so the dev server MUST be on 5173 or fetches CORS-fail.
- Screenshots: no repo dep added. Playwright installed in the scratchpad (`--no-save`); full
  chromium via `chromium.launch({ channel: 'chromium' })` (the default headless path wanted the
  chrome-headless-shell build which wasn't present). Script: scratchpad/shot.mjs.
